# User-Access-Management-System

Type: Backend-focused
Tech Stack: Node.js (likely with Express.js)

What you'll build:
----------------------
User registration/login
Role-based access control (RBAC)
JWT or session management
Probably some database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)

Why it's easier (for some):
---------------------------
Clear backend focus, no need to build a UI
Well-documented patterns for auth and access control
You can use libraries like bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, etc.

Challenges:
--------------
Understanding security concepts (password hashing, token auth)
Ensuring correct role/permission logic
